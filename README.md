## Introduction
DungeonGame is a simple game where you control a hero exploring a dungeon. Your goal is to collect gold, drink coffee for energy, and defeat the monster. This project focuses on demonstrating OOP concepts rather than complex graphics.

## Gameplay
The game starts by generating a random dungeon layout. You can move your hero around the dungeon. Collect gold to increase your score and drink coffee to restore health and score that allows user to defeat the monster and escape the dungeon.

## Features
* Random dungeon generation
* Hero movement and actions (move, drink coffee, attack)
* Enemy (monster) with health and attack
* Basic item system (gold, coffee)

## How to Play
To start the game, run the `Main` class. Use directional keys (w, a, s, d) to move the hero. Enter commands like "drink coffee" or "attack monster" to interact with objects.

## Technology Stack
* Java 11

## Project Structure
* `src`: Contains the source code for the game.

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated
* **Inheritance:** Character and Monster inherit from a base class Entity.
* **Polymorphism:** Different room types (e.g., start room, monster room) can be handled uniformly.
* **Encapsulation:** Game objects have well-defined interfaces and hide internal details.
